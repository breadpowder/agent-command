# SDLC PRD Feature $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
Product Requirements Document (PRD) creation workflow for new features. This command facilitates comprehensive requirements gathering, user story development, and business case documentation to establish clear feature specifications before development begins.

## Command Usage
```bash
# GitHub feature PRD creation
sdlc_prd_feature --source github --name user-authentication --type backend --id 123

# Local feature PRD creation
sdlc_prd_feature --source local --name mobile-dashboard --type frontend

# Bitbucket feature PRD creation
sdlc_prd_feature --source bitbucket --name payment-gateway --type fullstack --id 456

# Simple usage (auto-detects everything)
sdlc_prd_feature --name recommendation-engine
```

**Simplified Parameters:**
- `--name <descriptive-name>`: Feature workspace name (creates <project_root>/feature_<name>/)
- `--source <github|local|bitbucket>`: Input source (optional, defaults to local)
- `--type <frontend|backend|fullstack|mobile>`: Feature type (optional, auto-detected)
- `--id <identifier>`: External ID (issue#, epic#, etc) (optional)
- `--context <file|dir>`: Additional context file(s) or directory (optional)
- `--prompt "<instruction>"`: Inline task prompt to focus PRD scope (optional)

**Automatic Git Commits:**
This command creates commits at key checkpoints for traceability:
- `git commit -m "sdlc: prd feature <name> - requirements and stakeholder analysis complete"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - user story development complete"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - business case documentation complete"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - PRD creation complete"`
- **Rollback**: `git revert <commit_hash>` to safely undo changes (preserves history)
- **SECURITY**: `git reset` is strictly forbidden - always use `git revert` for traceability
- **IMPORTANT**: Agent must commit after each major step for traceability

## ðŸ”¹ PLAN

### 1. Comprehensive Requirements & Stakeholder Analysis

**Business Stakeholder Identification:**
- **Product Owners**: Feature champions and business requirements owners
- **End Users**: Target user segments and personas
- **Technical Stakeholders**: Engineering leads, architects, platform teams
- **Cross-functional Teams**: Design, QA, DevOps, Support, Marketing
- **External Partners**: Third-party integrations, vendors, compliance teams

**Requirements Collection Methods:**
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: One-on-one sessions with key stakeholders
- **User Research**: Surveys, focus groups, user testing sessions
- **Technical Assessment**: Platform capabilities, integration requirements, constraints, and risks
- **Business Case Analysis**: ROI calculations, success metrics, risk assessment

### 2. Context Storage (Feature-Focused Structure)
Store all PRD analysis and documentation in standardized directory structure:
Files are created or exists ONLY if applicable, e.g. feature new features or simple feature or non-api task, there might be no api-contract. observability.yaml,rollout-config.yaml.
```
<project_root>/feature_<name>/
â”œâ”€â”€ plan/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature-spec.md         # Single source of truth: PRD + Requirements merged
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user-stories.md         # Detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ business-case.md        # Business justification and success metrics
â”œâ”€â”€ specs/                      # Machine-readable specifications
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api-contract.yaml       # OpenAPI spec with examples and error shapes (if it is applicable)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ acceptance-tests.json   # Structured acceptance criteria
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ observability.yaml     # Metrics, alerts, dashboards, SLOs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rollout-config.yaml     # Feature flags, gating checks, backout steps
â”œâ”€â”€ issue/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ requirements.md         # Complete requirements including constraints and risks
â””â”€â”€ context/
    â””â”€â”€ source-reference.md     # Original source context and links
```

**IMPORTANT**: All PRD documentation must be created under `<project_root>/feature_<name>/` structure where `<name>` is the feature workspace name provided via `--name` parameter.

- **Definition of Ready**: Stories meet quality standards before development
- **Definition of Done**: Clear completion criteria for each story
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identification of story dependencies and sequencing

### 4. Business Case & Success Metrics

**Business Justification:**
- **Problem Statement**: Clear articulation of the problem being solved
- **Market Opportunity**: Size, growth potential, competitive landscape
- **User Value Proposition**: Benefits delivered to end users
- **Business Value**: Revenue impact, cost savings, strategic alignment
- **Success Metrics**: KPIs, OKRs, and measurable outcomes
