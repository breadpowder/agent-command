# SDLC PRD Feature $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
Product Requirements Document (PRD) creation workflow for new features. This command facilitates comprehensive requirements gathering, user story development, and business case documentation to establish clear feature specifications before development begins.

## Command Usage
```bash
# GitHub feature PRD creation
sdlc_prd_feature --source github --name user-authentication --type backend --id 123

# Local feature PRD creation
sdlc_prd_feature --source local --name mobile-dashboard --type frontend

# Bitbucket feature PRD creation
sdlc_prd_feature --source bitbucket --name payment-gateway --type fullstack --id 456

# Simple usage (auto-detects everything)
sdlc_prd_feature --name recommendation-engine
```

**Simplified Parameters:**
- `--name <descriptive-name>`: Feature workspace name (creates <project_root>/<name>/)
- `--source <github|local|bitbucket>`: Input source (optional, defaults to local)
- `--type <frontend|backend|fullstack|mobile>`: Feature type (optional, auto-detected)
- `--id <identifier>`: External ID (issue#, epic#, etc) (optional)
- `--context <file|dir>`: Additional context file(s) or directory (optional)
- `--prompt "<instruction>"`: Inline task prompt to focus PRD scope (optional)

**Automatic Git Commits:**
This command creates commits at key checkpoints for traceability:
- `git commit -m "sdlc: prd feature <name> - stakeholder analysis complete"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - user story development complete"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - business case documentation complete"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - PRD creation complete"`
- **Rollback**: `git revert <commit_hash>` to safely undo changes (preserves history)
- **SECURITY**: `git reset` is strictly forbidden - always use `git revert` for traceability
- **IMPORTANT**: Agent must commit after each major step for traceability
