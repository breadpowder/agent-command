# SDLC understand requirement $ARGUMENTS

## Context first
- Gather relevant context from the workspace structure (README.md, AGENTS.md, commands/, existing
  task_*/ workspaces) before planning or executing any task.
- Context7 references are optional; use them only when you need to refer to or verify third-party
  APIs.

## Purpose
Initial requirement understanding and clarification workflow that transforms raw user input into a concise, validated starting point. Clarification‚ÄëFirst: reflect user intent, bundle clarifying questions, wait for confirmation, and record assumptions as ‚Äúunconfirmed‚Äù. Keep focus on solving the problem with backward compatibility in mind.

## Command usage
```bash
# GitHub requirement understanding
sdlc_understand_requirement --source github --name user-dashboard --type feature --id 123

# Local requirement understanding
sdlc_understand_requirement --source local --name payment-system --type enhancement

# Bitbucket requirement understanding  
sdlc_understand_requirement --source bitbucket --name api-redesign --id 456

# Simple usage (auto-detects everything)
sdlc_understand_requirement --name mobile-app --prompt "Users want better search functionality"

# File-based context (brief/spec file)
sdlc_understand_requirement --source file --name reporting --type feature --context docs/brief.md
```

**Simplified parameters:**
 - `--name <descriptive-name>`: Requirement workspace name (creates <project_root>/task_<name>/)
 - `--source <github|local|bitbucket|file>`: Input source (optional, defaults to local)
 - `--type <feature|enhancement|bugfix|integration>`: Requirement type (optional, auto-detected)
 - `--id <identifier>`: External ID (issue#, ticket#, etc) (optional)
 - `--context <file|dir>`: Additional context file(s) or directory (optional)
 - `--prompt "<instruction>"`: Initial user requirement description (optional)
 - `--complexity <small|medium|large>`: Optional; if omitted, auto-detected

Safety and scope:
- Non-destructive: writes documentation only under `task_<name>/`.
- No code changes, builds, or deployments in this phase.
- Prefer follow-up questions over assumptions; clearly tag assumptions.

**Automatic git commits:**
This command creates commits at key checkpoints for traceability:
- `git commit -m "sdlc: understand requirement <name> - initial analysis complete"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - clarification questions and gaps identified"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - user stories drafted and validated"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - structured requirements ready for PRD"`
- **Rollback**: `git revert <commit_hash>` to safely undo changes (preserves history)
- **SECURITY**: `git reset` is strictly forbidden - always use `git revert` for traceability
- **IMPORTANT**: Agent must commit after each major step for traceability

### Outputs
- `task_<name>/requirement/analysis/requirement_analysis.md`
- Optional: `task_<name>/requirement/user-stories/stories.md`
- Optional (medium/large): `task_<name>/requirement/requirements/requirements.md`

## üîπ Plan

### 1. Initial requirement analysis and gap identification

Non-assumption principle:
- Reflect back user intent in your own words before proceeding.
- Ask clarifying questions when uncertain instead of presuming details.
- Track every assumption in an assumption log and mark it ‚Äúunconfirmed‚Äù until validated.
- Separate facts (from user/context) from interpretations and hypotheses.

Raw input processing:
- User intent extraction: Parse initial user description to identify core intent and desired outcomes
- Assumption detection: Identify unstated assumptions and implicit requirements in user input
- Scope boundary discovery: Understand what user considers in-scope vs out-of-scope
- Context mining: Extract relevant business context, user personas, and use case scenarios
- Constraint identification: Discover technical, business, timeline, and resource constraints

Gap analysis framework:
- Missing information detection: Identify critical gaps in user requirements
- Ambiguity flagging: Highlight vague or unclear requirement statements
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify potential dependencies not mentioned by user
- **Risk Signal Detection**: Flag potential risks based on requirement complexity
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Determine who else needs to be involved beyond the initial user

### 2. Context storage (requirement-focused structure)
Store all requirement analysis and clarification in standardized directory structure (one file per leaf):
```
<project_root>/task_<name>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirement/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis/requirement_analysis.md   # input, assumptions (unconfirmed), clarifying questions, summary
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-stories/stories.md            # optional for features
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements/requirements.md       # optional (medium/large)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirement/handoff/handoff_requirements.md   # optional
```

Important: create all requirement documentation under `<project_root>/task_<name>/` where `<name>` is provided via `--name`.

### 3. Interactive clarification process

Systematic question framework:
- What questions: What exactly does the user want to achieve? What are the specific outcomes?
- Who questions: Who are the end users? Who are the stakeholders? Who has decision authority?
- When questions: What are the timeline expectations? When is this needed? Are there deadlines?
- Where questions: Where will this be used? What platforms/environments are involved?
- Why questions: Why is this important? What problem does it solve? What is the business value?
- How questions: How do users currently handle this? How should the new solution work?

Reflective summary template (add to `analysis/reflection.md`):
- Problem statement (in your words): <one paragraph>
- Known facts (from user/context): <bulleted list>
- Unknowns and open questions: <bulleted list>
- Explicit assumptions (to confirm): <bulleted list>
- Risks and constraints observed: <bulleted list>
- Proposed scope boundaries: <in/out of scope bullets>

Clarifying question template (add to `analysis/clarification-questions.md`):
- Goal/outcome: <question>
- User segments/personas: <question>
- Success criteria/metrics: <question>
- Constraints (time, budget, tech): <question>
- Dependencies/integrations: <question>
- Edge cases/failure modes: <question>
- Non-functional expectations (perf, security, accessibility, compliance): <question>

**Progressive Clarification Strategy:**
- **Round 1**: High-level clarification of scope, goals, and constraints
- **Round 2**: Detailed user story validation and acceptance criteria refinement
- **Round 3**: Edge case identification and non-functional requirement hints
- **Round 4**: Final validation and structured requirement confirmation

### 4. User Story Development & Validation

**Story Elicitation Techniques:**
- **As-a-user Format**: Convert requirements into "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]" format
- **Scenario Mapping**: Identify primary, secondary, and edge case scenarios
- **User Journey Analysis**: Map end-to-end user flows and interaction points
- **Pain Point Focus**: Ensure stories address specific user pain points and frustrations
- **Value Validation**: Confirm each story delivers clear user or business value

**Story Quality Validation:**
- **Completeness Check**: Ensure stories cover all identified requirements
- **Independence Verification**: Confirm stories can be implemented independently
- **Testability Assessment**: Validate that acceptance criteria are measurable and verifiable
- **Size Estimation**: Ensure stories are appropriately sized for implementation
- **Priority Clarification**: Understand story priority from user perspective
