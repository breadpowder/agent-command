# SDLC Understand Requirement $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
Initial requirement understanding and clarification workflow that transforms raw user input into structured, validated requirements ready for PRD development. This command focuses on deep requirement analysis, stakeholder clarification, and user story refinement before formal product requirement documentation begins.

## Command Usage
```bash
# GitHub requirement understanding
sdlc_understand_requirement --source github --name user-dashboard --type feature --id 123

# Local requirement understanding
sdlc_understand_requirement --source local --name payment-system --type enhancement

# Bitbucket requirement understanding  
sdlc_understand_requirement --source bitbucket --name api-redesign --id 456

# Simple usage (auto-detects everything)
sdlc_understand_requirement --name mobile-app --prompt "Users want better search functionality"
```

**Simplified Parameters:**
- `--name <descriptive-name>`: Requirement workspace name (creates <project_root>/requirement_<name>/)
- `--source <github|local|bitbucket>`: Input source (optional, defaults to local)
- `--type <feature|enhancement|bugfix|integration>`: Requirement type (optional, auto-detected)
- `--id <identifier>`: External ID (issue#, ticket#, etc) (optional)
- `--context <file|dir>`: Additional context file(s) or directory (optional)
- `--prompt "<instruction>"`: Initial user requirement description (optional)

**Automatic Git Commits:**
This command creates commits at key checkpoints for traceability:
- `git commit -m "sdlc: understand requirement <name> - initial analysis complete"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - clarification questions and gaps identified"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - user stories drafted and validated"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - structured requirements ready for PRD"`
- **Rollback**: `git revert <commit_hash>` to safely undo changes (preserves history)
- **SECURITY**: `git reset` is strictly forbidden - always use `git revert` for traceability
- **IMPORTANT**: Agent must commit after each major step for traceability

## ðŸ”¹ PLAN

### 1. Initial Requirement Analysis & Gap Identification

**Raw Input Processing:**
- **User Intent Extraction**: Parse initial user description to identify core intent and desired outcomes
- **Assumption Detection**: Identify unstated assumptions and implicit requirements in user input
- **Scope Boundary Discovery**: Understand what user considers in-scope vs out-of-scope
- **Context Mining**: Extract relevant business context, user personas, and use case scenarios
- **Constraint Identification**: Discover technical, business, timeline, and resource constraints

**Gap Analysis Framework:**
- **Missing Information Detection**: Identify critical gaps in user requirements
- **Ambiguity Flagging**: Highlight vague or unclear requirement statements
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify potential dependencies not mentioned by user
- **Risk Signal Detection**: Flag potential risks based on requirement complexity
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Determine who else needs to be involved beyond the initial user

### 2. Context Storage (Requirement-Focused Structure)
Store all requirement analysis and clarification in standardized directory structure:
```
<project_root>/requirement_<name>/
â”œâ”€â”€ analysis/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ initial-requirement.md      # Original user input and context captured
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gap-analysis.md            # Identified gaps, ambiguities, and missing info
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ clarification-questions.md # Structured questions for user clarification
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assumption-log.md          # Documented assumptions and validation needs
â”œâ”€â”€ user-stories/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ draft-stories.md           # Initial user story drafts with acceptance criteria
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ story-validation.md        # User feedback and story refinements
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ story-prioritization.md    # Story priority and dependency mapping
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ functional-requirements.md # Validated functional requirements
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ non-functional-hints.md    # Early NFR indicators and constraints
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ acceptance-criteria.md     # Detailed acceptance criteria per requirement
â””â”€â”€ handoff/
    â”œâ”€â”€ structured-requirements.md  # Final structured requirements for PRD input
    â”œâ”€â”€ open-questions.md          # Remaining questions with assigned owners
    â””â”€â”€ next-steps.md              # Recommended next phase actions
```

**IMPORTANT**: All requirement documentation must be created under `<project_root>/requirement_<name>/` structure where `<name>` is the requirement workspace name provided via `--name` parameter.

### 3. Interactive Clarification Process

**Systematic Question Framework:**
- **What Questions**: What exactly does the user want to achieve? What are the specific outcomes?
- **Who Questions**: Who are the end users? Who are the stakeholders? Who has decision authority?
- **When Questions**: What are the timeline expectations? When is this needed? Are there deadlines?
- **Where Questions**: Where will this be used? What platforms/environments are involved?
- **Why Questions**: Why is this important? What problem does it solve? What's the business value?
- **How Questions**: How do users currently handle this? How should the new solution work?

**Progressive Clarification Strategy:**
- **Round 1**: High-level clarification of scope, goals, and constraints
- **Round 2**: Detailed user story validation and acceptance criteria refinement
- **Round 3**: Edge case identification and non-functional requirement hints
- **Round 4**: Final validation and structured requirement confirmation

### 4. User Story Development & Validation

**Story Elicitation Techniques:**
- **As-a-user Format**: Convert requirements into "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]" format
- **Scenario Mapping**: Identify primary, secondary, and edge case scenarios
- **User Journey Analysis**: Map end-to-end user flows and interaction points
- **Pain Point Focus**: Ensure stories address specific user pain points and frustrations
- **Value Validation**: Confirm each story delivers clear user or business value

**Story Quality Validation:**

- **Independence Verification**: Confirm stories can be implemented independently
- **Testability Assessment**: Validate that acceptance criteria are measurable and verifiable
- **Size Estimation**: Ensure stories are appropriately sized for implementation
- **Priority Clarification**: Understand story priority from user perspective
