- Performance implications and optimization opportunities
- Testing requirements and validation strategies
- Team training and knowledge transfer needs

### 4. Task Breakdown (2-Hour Rule)

**CRITICAL: Phased Refactoring Approach**
- **Phase 1**: Analysis and design documentation (â‰¤2h)
- **Phase 2**: Interface design and contract definition (â‰¤2h)
- **Phase 3**: Core component refactoring (â‰¤2h per component)
- **Phase 4**: Integration and compatibility testing (â‰¤2h)
- **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and validation (â‰¤2h)
- **Phase 6**: Documentation and migration guide creation (â‰¤2h)

**Task Independence:**
- Each phase delivers working, testable improvements
- Rollback capability maintained at every checkpoint
- Independent validation of each refactoring increment
- Clear dependency mapping between refactoring phases

### Branch Management

**Refactoring Branch Strategy:**
- **Long-running refactoring**: `refactor-<name>-<component>`
- **Incremental refactoring**: `refactor-<phase>-<component>`
- **Feature-based refactoring**: `refactor-feature-<id>-<description>`
- **Architecture refactoring**: `refactor-arch-<system>-<pattern>`

**Branch Management Best Practices:**
- Regular merges from main to avoid conflicts
- Feature flags for gradual rollout of refactored components
- Parallel development support with clear integration points

### Implementation Strategy

**Systematic Refactoring Approach:**
1. **Interface Stabilization**: Define and implement new interfaces first
2. **Incremental Migration**: Replace implementations while preserving interfaces
3. **Dependency Injection**: Implement inversion of control patterns
4. **Test Coverage**: Maintain or improve test coverage throughout process
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance validation during refactoring

### Step-by-Step Development

**Phase-Based Implementation:**
- **Phase 1**: Interface design and abstract base class creation
- **Phase 2**: Core logic refactoring with design pattern implementation
- **Phase 3**: Dependency injection and inversion of control
- **Phase 4**: Performance optimization and resource management
- **Phase 5**: Backward compatibility layer and migration utilities

## ðŸ”¹ TEST

### Testing Strategy

**Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure existing functionality preserved
- **Unit Tests**: New components and refactored logic validation
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and interface compliance
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark comparison and optimization validation

## Advanced Refactoring Patterns

### Dependency Injection Implementation
```python
# Before: Tight coupling
class Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = MemorySession()  # Hard dependency

# After: Dependency injection
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, memory_session: Optional[MemorySession] = None):
        self.memory_session = memory_session or create_default_memory()
```

### Interface-Based Architecture
```python
# Abstract base class with clear contracts
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AgentInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, input_data: Any) -> Any:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def configure(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        pass
```

### Factory Pattern Implementation
```python
# Centralized object creation
def create_agent(agent_type: str, **kwargs) -> AgentInterface:
    if agent_type == "memory":
        return MemoryAgent(**kwargs)
    elif agent_type == "stateless":
        return StatelessAgent(**kwargs)
    raise ValueError(f"Unknown agent type: {agent_type}")
```
