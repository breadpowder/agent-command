# SDLC Plan Feature $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
Specialized feature planning that performs requirements analysis, technical feasibility, option
evaluation, and task breakdown. This command produces a clear, agreed plan without writing code
or running tests.

## Command Usage
```bash
# GitHub feature planning
sdlc_plan_feature --source github --name user-dashboard --type frontend --id 789

# Local feature planning
sdlc_plan_feature --source local --name payment-system --type backend

# Bitbucket feature planning
sdlc_plan_feature --source bitbucket --name api-redesign --id 456

# Simple usage (auto-detects everything)
sdlc_plan_feature --name mobile-app
```

**Simplified Parameters:**
- `--name <descriptive-name>`: Workspace name (creates <project_root>/<name>/)
- `--source <github|local|bitbucket>`: Input source (optional, defaults to local)
- `--type <frontend|backend|fullstack>`: Feature type (optional, auto-detected)
- `--id <identifier>`: External ID (issue#, PR#, etc) (optional)
- `--context <file|dir>`: Additional context file(s) or directory (optional)
- `--prompt "<instruction>"`: Inline task prompt to focus planning (optional)

**Automatic Git Commits:**
This command creates commits at key checkpoints for traceability:
- `git commit -m "sdlc: plan feature <name> - requirements analysis complete"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - architecture options documented"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - decision recorded and rationale"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - task breakdown complete"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - feature planning complete"`
- Rollback: use `git revert <commit_hash>` (never `git reset`).

## ðŸ”¹ PLAN
### 1. Context gathering and analysis
- Requirement analysis: parse stories, acceptance criteria, constraints, assumptions, plus any
  provided `--context` materials and `--prompt` intent.
- Stakeholder mapping: users, internal teams, compliance, external integrations.
- Technical feasibility: identify complexity hot-spots and integration points.
- Business impact: value, scope boundaries, out-of-scope items.

### 2. Options analysis and decision
- Architecture options: list 2â€“3 viable approaches with pros/cons and risks.
- Technology choices: alternatives with trade-offs and constraints.
- Data model options: implications for migrations and compatibility.
- Decision gate: present options to the user and record the selection and rationale in
  `plan/decision-log.md` before proceeding.

### 3. Task breakdown (2-hour rule)
- Decompose into independent, verifiable tasks â‰¤2h each.
- Define validation criteria per task and explicit dependencies.
- Order for incremental value and early risk reduction.

### 4. Planning artifacts and structure
Store planning in a standardized structure:
Files are created ONLY if applicable, e.g. feature new features or simple feature or non-api task, there might be no api-contract. observability.yaml,rollout-config.yaml.
```

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ risks.md                # Risks, mitigations, open questions
â””â”€â”€ context/
    â””â”€â”€ source-reference.md     # Links, tickets, prior art
```

## Collaboration checkpoints
- Clarify requirements and constraints; confirm understanding before analysis.
- Present 2â€“3 option sets with pros/cons; request user selection.
- Share task breakdown; request approval before freezing the plan.

### 5. Definition of Ready & Quality Standards

**Definition of Ready - Before Implementation:**
- Requirements analysis complete with clear boundaries and constraints
- Architecture options evaluated with 2-3 viable approaches documented
- Technology choices justified with trade-offs and constraints analysis
- Data model implications assessed for migrations and compatibility  
- Task breakdown complete with â‰¤2h tasks and validation criteria
- Dependencies mapped with explicit ordering and risk assessment
- Machine-readable specs created (API contracts, config schemas)
- Observability plan defined with metrics, alerts, and SLO targets
- Rollout strategy planned with feature flags and backout procedures
- Decision log updated with selected options and rationale

**Traceability Requirements:**
- Map Goals â†’ Requirements â†’ Tests â†’ Tasks
- Maintain lightweight matrix (CSV/Markdown) or tags for CI validation
- Each task must reference specific requirements and acceptance criteria

## Outputs
- Updated planning workspace as above with machine-readable specs
- Recorded decisions with rationale and impact assessment
- Finalized task breakdown ready for implementation handoff
- Quality gates and CI automation guidance established
