# SDLC Implement Feature $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
Specialized feature implementation that turns an approved plan into code. This command focuses on
writing code and related configuration only; testing and deployment are handled by separate
commands.

## Command Usage
```bash
# GitHub feature implementation
sdlc_implement_feature --source github --name user-auth --type backend --id 123

# Local feature implementation
sdlc_implement_feature --source local --name ui-components --type frontend

# Bitbucket feature implementation
sdlc_implement_feature --source bitbucket --name api-refactor --id 456

# Simple usage (auto-detects everything)
sdlc_implement_feature --name payment-system
```

**Simplified Parameters:**
- `--name <descriptive-name>`: Workspace name (creates <project_root>/<name>/)
- `--source <github|local|bitbucket>`: Input source (optional, defaults to local)
- `--type <backend|frontend|fullstack>`: Implementation type (optional, auto-detected)
- `--id <identifier>`: External ID (issue#, PR#, etc) (optional)
- `--context <file|dir>`: Additional context file(s) or directory (optional)
- `--prompt "<instruction>"`: Inline task prompt to focus implementation (optional)

**Automatic Git Commits:**
This command creates commits at key checkpoints for traceability:
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - implementation plan confirmed"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - core functionality implemented"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - configuration and docs updated"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - feature implementation complete"`
- Rollback: use `git revert <commit_hash>` (never `git reset`).

## ðŸ”¹ PLAN
### 1. Scope confirmation
- Load planning artifacts: requirements, decision log, task breakdown, and any `--context` files
  or `--prompt` details provided.
- Confirm acceptance criteria and out-of-scope items with the user.

### 2. Design choices and options
- Present focused choices where relevant (API shape, storage format, error strategy) with
  pros/cons and impact on complexity, performance, and compatibility.
- Decision gate: record selected options in `<name>/plan/decision-log.md` before coding.

### 3. Task breakdown (2-hour rule)
- Sequence tasks for incremental value; keep tasks â‰¤2h with clear validation criteria.
- Identify integration points and required feature flags or config toggles.

## ðŸ”¹ CREATE
### Branch management
- Create a feature branch from the correct base and follow naming conventions
  (`feature/<name>` or `feat/<ticket>`). Commit incrementally and atomically.

### Implementation steps
1. Foundation: data models, interfaces, configuration scaffolding.
2. Business logic: core functionality behind feature flags where appropriate.
3. API/surface: endpoints, handlers, UI components, or CLIs as applicable.
4. Integration: connect to dependencies and existing modules.
5. Observability: add logging and metrics relevant to the new code paths.

### Quality guidelines (in-implementation)
- Error handling and input validation follow existing patterns.
- Security-by-default: least privilege, avoid secrets in code, sanitize inputs.
- Performance-conscious changes; avoid hotspots and unnecessary allocations.
- Documentation updates: inline docstrings and `docs/` or README snippets as needed.

## Handoff
- Open a PR and request review using the repositoryâ€™s checklist.
- Trigger testing via `sdlc_setup_testing` and update coverage where needed.

## Collaboration checkpoints
- Confirm scope and acceptance criteria before coding.
- Present design option trade-offs and request user selection.
- Walk through the PR diff with the user if requested.

## Outputs
- Implemented code and configuration on a feature branch.
- Updated documentation and decision log.
- Ready for `code_review`, `sdlc_setup_testing`, and `sdlc_deploy_changes`.
