# SDLC Implement Feature $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
Specialized feature implementation that turns an approved plan into code. This command focuses on
writing code and related configuration only; testing and deployment are handled by separate
commands.

## Command Usage
```bash
# GitHub feature implementation
sdlc_implement_feature --source github --name user-auth --type backend --id 123

# Local feature implementation
sdlc_implement_feature --source local --name ui-components --type frontend

# Bitbucket feature implementation
sdlc_implement_feature --source bitbucket --name api-refactor --id 456

# Simple usage (auto-detects everything)
sdlc_implement_feature --name payment-system
```

**Simplified Parameters:**
- `--name <descriptive-name>`: Workspace name (creates <project_root>/feature_<name>/)
- `--source <github|local|bitbucket>`: Input source (optional, defaults to local)
- `--type <backend|frontend|fullstack>`: Implementation type (optional, auto-detected)
- `--id <identifier>`: External ID (issue#, PR#, etc) (optional)
- `--context <file|dir>`: Additional context file(s) or directory (optional)
- `--prompt "<instruction>"`: Inline task prompt to focus implementation (optional)

**Automatic Git Commits:**
This command creates commits at key checkpoints for traceability:
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - implementation plan confirmed"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - core functionality implemented"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - configuration and docs updated"`
- `git commit -m "sdlc: <name> - feature implementation complete"`
- Rollback: use `git revert <commit_hash>` (never `git reset`).

## ðŸ”¹ PLAN
### 1. Scope confirmation
- Load planning artifacts: requirements, decision log, task breakdown, and any `--context` files
  or `--prompt` details provided.
- Confirm acceptance criteria and out-of-scope items with the user.

### 2. Design choices and options
- Present focused choices where relevant (API shape, storage format, error strategy) with
  pros/cons and impact on complexity, performance, and compatibility.
- Decision gate: record selected options in `<name>/plan/decision-log.md` before coding.

### 3. Task breakdown (2-hour rule)
- Sequence tasks for incremental value; keep tasks â‰¤2h with clear validation criteria.
- Identify integration points and required feature flags or config toggles.

## ðŸ”¹ CREATE
### Branch management
- Create a feature branch from the correct base and follow naming conventions
  (`feature/<name>` or `feat/<ticket>`). Commit incrementally and atomically.

### Implementation steps
1. Foundation: data models, interfaces, configuration scaffolding.
2. Business logic: core functionality behind feature flags where appropriate.
3. API/surface: endpoints, handlers, UI components, or CLIs as applicable.
4. Integration: connect to dependencies and existing modules.
5. Observability: add logging, metrics, traces with SLO tracking.
6. Backward compatibility: API versioning, schema evolution, migration safety.
7. Edge cases and failure modes: timeouts, retries, idempotency, partial failures.
8. Rollout preparation: feature flags, kill switches, configuration validation.

### Quality guidelines (in-implementation)
- **Error handling**: Follow patterns from USER_LEVEL_CLAUDE.md Â§ "Error Handling and Resilience" (exception hierarchy, graceful degradation)
- **Security standards**: Apply USER_LEVEL_CLAUDE.md Â§ "Security Standards" (input validation, secrets management, security checklist)
- **Logging**: Use standards from USER_LEVEL_CLAUDE.md Â§ "Logging Standards" (centralized logging, appropriate levels, structured format)
- **Testing**: Follow USER_LEVEL_CLAUDE.md Â§ "Testing Guidelines" (pytest, 80% coverage, TDD patterns)
- **Performance**: Avoid hotspots, follow USER_LEVEL_CLAUDE.md Â§ "Performance Guidelines" 
- **Documentation**: Inline docstrings and updates per USER_LEVEL_CLAUDE.md Â§ "Code Quality Standards"

## Handoff
- Open a PR and request review using the repositoryâ€™s checklist.
- Trigger testing via `sdlc_test` and update coverage where needed.

## Collaboration checkpoints
- Confirm scope and acceptance criteria before coding.
- Present design option trade-offs and request user selection.
- Walk through the PR diff with the user if requested.

### 4. Quality Gates and Definition of Done

**Implementation Quality Gates:**
- All acceptance criteria implemented and testable
- API contracts match specifications with examples and error handling
- Observability instrumentation complete (metrics, logs, traces)
- Feature flags configured with kill switches and rollback capability
- Backward compatibility maintained with proper API versioning
- Edge cases handled: timeouts, retries, idempotency, partial failures
- Security validations: input sanitization, auth/authz, secrets management
- Performance considerations: no hotspots, resource-conscious design

**Test Strategy Integration:**
- Unit tests for business logic with clear isolation
- Integration tests for API endpoints and data flows  
- E2E tests for critical user paths and acceptance criteria
- Performance smoke tests with budget enforcement
- Security tests for auth, input validation, and data protection

## Outputs
- Implemented code and configuration on a feature branch
- Updated documentation and decision log with implementation decisions
- Machine-readable specs validated and aligned with implementation
- Ready for `code_review`, `sdlc_test`, and `sdlc_deploy`
