# Hybrid Memory Feature - Planning Summary

## Planning Status: COMPLETE ✅
**Date**: 2025-10-13  
**Phase**: sdlc_plan_feature execution completed  
**Workspace**: memory/task_hybrid_memory/ (local context only)

## Planning Outputs Created
- **Task Breakdown**: 3 tasks following 2-hour rule with detailed pseudocode
- **Decision Log**: 5 key technical decisions with Context7 validation
- **Architecture**: Validated Graphiti + Neo4j + Claude Code MCP integration

## Key Deliverables Planned

### 1. docker-compose.yml (Task 1 - 1.5h)
- Neo4j 5.26 container configuration
- Standard ports (7474, 7687) with proper authentication
- Volume persistence and memory optimization
- Environment variable based configuration

### 2. bootstrap.sh (Task 2 - 2h)  
- Single command setup automation
- Prerequisites validation (Docker, Claude Code CLI, API key)
- Neo4j startup and readiness checking
- Graphiti MCP server setup (uv preferred, pip fallback)
- Claude Code MCP registration with stdio transport

### 3. README.md (Task 3 - 1h)
- Clear setup instructions and prerequisites
- One-liner usage command  
- Verification steps for successful installation
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Technical Architecture (Context7 Validated)
```
Claude Code ──(MCP stdio)── Graphiti MCP Server (uv/local)
                                    │
                       ┌────────────┴────────────┐
                       │                         │
                   Neo4j (Docker)        Semantic Index (OpenAI)
```

## Key Decisions Made

1. **MCP Transport**: stdio (officially supported by Claude Code CLI)
2. **Neo4j Version**: 5.26 Docker container (stable, easy setup)
3. **Dependency Management**: uv preferred with pip fallback  
4. **Environment Strategy**: Shell variables with defaults
5. **Bootstrap Architecture**: Single bash script for one-command setup

## Quality Gates Status
- [x] Context7 MCP technical validation completed
- [x] Requirements analysis from one_page_hybrid_memory.md
- [x] Technology stack confirmed and documented
- [x] Task breakdown with implementation pseudocode
- [x] Acceptance criteria defined for each deliverable
- [x] Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Ready for Implementation
All planning artifacts created in workspace `memory/task_hybrid_memory/` following SDLC command structure. Implementation can proceed with:
- Clear technical specifications
- Validated technology choices  
- Detailed task breakdown with time estimates
- Comprehensive decision rationale

## Next Phase
Ready to execute `sdlc_implement_feature --name hybrid_memory` to create the deliverables according to this plan.
